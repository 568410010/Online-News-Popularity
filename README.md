# Online-News-Popularity
The impact that modern social media has had on our daily life, and society in general, is undeniable. The major means that social media influence the public is by creating topics of discussion in the society. In this project, I use a set of predictors to predict if an article would become popular or not. And try to give authors some actionable suggestions to improve the online news popularity. I will use some methods, such as forward stepwise selection, to identify a subset of the predictors related to the response. Then given a set of predictor values (e.g., keywords, number of words in the title, rate of positive words in an article), we could also give some actionable suggestions to improve the popularity of a post.
